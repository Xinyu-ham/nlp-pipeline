This is useful because we can then load the data in parallel and train on it. Image we have a big ass dataset instead, there will be quite a huge problem if the dataset becomes too big to be fully loaded into memory. By spliting the files up, we can allow data to be trained in batches, and only a single batch of data is loaded each weight update."
