    "One of the cool things we can do to a dataset is that we don't need to keep it as a single file. We can split it into multiple files and save it to the cloud. This is useful because we can then load the data in parallel and train on it. Image we have a big ass dataset instead, there will be quite a huge problem if the dataset becomes too big to be fully loaded into memory. By spliting the files up, we can allow data to be trained in batches, and only a single batch of data is loaded each weight update."
